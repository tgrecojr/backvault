# 🗄️ BackVault

**BackVault** is a lightweight Dockerized service that periodically backs up your **Bitwarden** or **Vaultwarden** vaults into password-protected encrypted files.  
It’s designed for hands-free, secure, and automated backups using the official Bitwarden CLI.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔒 Securely exports your vault using your Bitwarden credentials
- 🕐 **Interval-based backup scheduling** — configure backup frequency in hours
- 💾 Password-protected backup files using AES encryption
- 🧹 **Automated Cleanup**: Automatically deletes old backups daily at midnight based on configurable retention period
- ✨ **Two Encryption Modes**: Choose between Bitwarden's native encrypted format or a portable, standard AES-256-GCM encrypted format
- 🔐 **Security Hardened**: Non-root execution, log redaction, retry logic with exponential backoff
- 🌐 Works with both Bitwarden Cloud and self-hosted Bitwarden/Vaultwarden
- 🏗️ **Multi-Architecture Support**: Native images for amd64, arm64, and arm/v7 (Raspberry Pi)
- 🐳 Runs fully containerized — no setup or local dependencies required

---

## 📦 Quick Start (Docker)

You can run BackVault directly using the **published Docker image**, no build required.

**Available Images:**
- GitHub Container Registry: `ghcr.io/tgrecojr/backvault:latest`
- Multi-architecture support: amd64, arm64, arm/v7 (Raspberry Pi compatible)

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name backvault \
  -e BW_CLIENT_ID="your_client_id" \
  -e BW_CLIENT_SECRET="your_client_secret" \
  -e BW_PASSWORD="your_master_password" \
  -e BW_SERVER="https://vault.yourdomain.com" \
  -e BW_FILE_PASSWORD="backup_encryption_password" \
  -e BACKUP_ENCRYPTION_MODE="raw" \
  -e BACKUP_INTERVAL_HOURS=12 \
  -v /path/to/backup:/app/backups \
  --security-opt seccomp=unconfined \
  ghcr.io/tgrecojr/backvault:latest
```

> ⚠️ **Security Requirement**: The `--security-opt seccomp=unconfined` flag is **required** for the Bitwarden CLI to function properly inside the container.

> 🔑 **Important**: The container uses the official Bitwarden CLI internally.
> Your credentials are only used to generate the export — they are **never stored** persistently and **never sent** anywhere else.

---

## 🧩 Docker Compose Example

Here’s how to set it up with Docker Compose for easy management:

```yaml
services:
  backvault:
    image: ghcr.io/tgrecojr/backvault:latest
    container_name: backvault
    restart: unless-stopped

    # Run as current user to avoid permission issues with mounted volumes
    user: "${UID:-1000}:${GID:-1000}"

    # REQUIRED: Bitwarden CLI needs this to run
    security_opt:
      - seccomp=unconfined

    environment:
      BW_CLIENT_ID: "your_client_id"
      BW_CLIENT_SECRET: "your_client_secret"
      BW_PASSWORD: "your_master_password"
      BW_SERVER: "https://vault.yourdomain.com"
      BW_FILE_PASSWORD: "backup_encryption_password"
      BACKUP_ENCRYPTION_MODE: "raw" # Use 'bitwarden' for the default format
      BACKUP_INTERVAL_HOURS: 12
      RETAIN_DAYS: 7

      # Uncomment if using self-signed certificates
      # NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED: 0

    volumes:
      - ./backups:/app/backups
```

Then run:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

BackVault will automatically:

1. Log in to your Bitwarden/Vaultwarden instance
2. Export your vault
3. Encrypt it using `BW_FILE_PASSWORD`
4. Store the backup in `/app/backups` (mounted to your host directory)
5. Logout after every backup

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### Master Password Storage

**Important**: BackVault requires your Bitwarden master password (`BW_PASSWORD`) to unlock and export your vault. This is a fundamental requirement of the Bitwarden CLI and cannot be avoided.

**Current Implementation:**
- Password is passed via environment variable
- Never logged or stored persistently
- Redacted from all log output
- Vault is locked immediately after each backup

**⚠️ Security Risks:**
- Environment variables are visible in `docker inspect <container>`
- May appear in container orchestration logs
- Stored in plain text in docker-compose.yml files

**Recommendations:**
1. **For production use**, consider using Docker Secrets or Kubernetes Secrets instead of environment variables
2. Store your `docker-compose.yml` and `.env` files securely with appropriate file permissions
3. Use a dedicated backup password (`BW_FILE_PASSWORD`) different from your master password
4. Regularly rotate your API keys and passwords
5. Limit access to the backup directory with proper file system permissions

> 📋 **Note**: There is an open issue to add support for file-based secrets (e.g., `BW_PASSWORD_FILE`) as a more secure alternative. See the GitHub issues for details.

### Additional Security Features

- **Non-root execution**: Container runs as UID 1000 by default (configurable via `user:` in docker-compose)
- **Automated logout**: Session is terminated immediately after each backup
- **Retry logic**: Implements exponential backoff to prevent account lockouts
- **Strong encryption**: AES-256-GCM with PBKDF2 (600,000 iterations) for raw mode backups
- **Security audited**: See [SECURITYASSESS.md](SECURITYASSESS.md) for detailed security assessment

## 🔐 Decrypting Backups

BackVault supports two encryption modes, set by the `BACKUP_ENCRYPTION_MODE` environment variable. The decryption method depends on which mode was used to create the backup.

### Mode 1: `bitwarden` (Default)

This mode uses Bitwarden's native encrypted JSON format. It's secure but proprietary, meaning you **must use the Bitwarden CLI** to decrypt it.

**How to Decrypt:**

1.  Install the official **Bitwarden CLI**: bitwarden.com/help/cli/
2.  Config the CLI to point to your server with `bw config server`.
3.  Log in using `bw login`.
4.  Run the `import` command. This will decrypt the file and import it into your vault.

    ```bash
    # This command decrypts the file and imports it into a vault.
    bw import bitwardenjson /path/to/backup.enc
    ```

    You will be prompted to enter your encryption password before the import can complete.

> This method can be used to restore your vault into the same or a different Bitwarden account. The encryption is self-contained.

### Mode 2: `raw` (Recommended for Portability)

This mode exports the vault as raw JSON and then encrypts it in-memory using a standard, portable format: **AES-256-GCM** with a key derived using **Argon2id**.

The main advantage is that you **do not need the Bitwarden CLI** to decrypt your data, making it ideal for disaster recovery. You can use standard tools like Python or OpenSSL.

**File Structure:**
The resulting `.enc` file contains: `[4-byte version][16-byte salt][12-byte nonce][encrypted data + 16-byte auth tag]`

**Version History:**
- **Version 2** (Current): Argon2id key derivation (time_cost=3, memory_cost=64MB, parallelism=4) - Resistant to GPU/ASIC attacks
- **Version 1** (Legacy): PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 iterations: 600,000 (OWASP 2023 recommendation)

**How to Decrypt (Python Script):**

Here is a simple Python script to decrypt the file. You only need the `cryptography` and `argon2-cffi` libraries.

1.  Save the code below as `decrypt.py`.
2.  Install the dependencies: `pip install cryptography argon2-cffi`.
3.  Run the script: `python decrypt.py /path/to/backup.enc` (you will be prompted for the password)

The script supports both Version 1 (PBKDF2) and Version 2 (Argon2id) encrypted files automatically.

```python
# decrypt.py
import os
import sys
from getpass import getpass
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers.aead import AESGCM
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.kdf.pbkdf2 import PBKDF2HMAC

    # Read version header (4 bytes)
    version_num = int.from_bytes(encrypted_data[:4], byteorder="big")
    offset = 4

    salt = encrypted_data[offset:offset+SALT_SIZE]
    nonce = encrypted_data[offset+SALT_SIZE:offset+SALT_SIZE+12]
    ciphertext_with_tag = encrypted_data[offset+SALT_SIZE+12:]

    # Derive key based on version
    if version_num == 1:
        # Legacy PBKDF2 format
        print(f"Decrypting version {version_num} file (PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256, {PBKDF2_ITERATIONS:,} iterations)", file=sys.stderr)
        kdf = PBKDF2HMAC(
            algorithm=hashes.SHA256(),
            length=KEY_SIZE,
            salt=salt,
            iterations=PBKDF2_ITERATIONS
        )
        key = kdf.derive(password.encode("utf-8"))
    elif version_num == 2:
        # Current Argon2id format
        print(f"Decrypting version {version_num} file (Argon2id, {ARGON2_MEMORY_COST // 1024} MB)", file=sys.stderr)
        key = hash_secret_raw(
            secret=password.encode("utf-8"),
            salt=salt,
            time_cost=ARGON2_TIME_COST,
            memory_cost=ARGON2_MEMORY_COST,

            hash_len=KEY_SIZE,
            type=Type.ID,
        )
    else:
        raise ValueError(f"Unsupported encryption version: {version_num}")

    # Decrypt using AES-GCM
    aesgcm = AESGCM(key)
    return aesgcm.decrypt(nonce, ciphertext_with_tag, None)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    if len(sys.argv) < 2:
        print(f"Usage: python {sys.argv[0]} <encrypted_file>")
        sys.exit(1)

    file_path = sys.argv[1]
    password = getpass("Enter backup password: ")

    try:
        with open(file_path, "rb") as f:
            encrypted_contents = f.read()

        decrypted_json = decrypt_data(encrypted_contents, password)
        print(decrypted_json.decode("utf-8"))
        print("\nDecryption successful.", file=sys.stderr)
    except InvalidTag:
        print("Decryption failed: Invalid password or corrupted file.", file=sys.stderr)
        sys.exit(1)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}", file=sys.stderr)
        sys.exit(1)
```

## 🧠 Tips

* **Store `BW_FILE_PASSWORD` securely** — it's required for restoring backups and cannot be recovered if lost
* You can run this container alongside Vaultwarden on the same host or a separate machine
* Combine with tools like `restic` or `rclone` to push backups to cloud storage for offsite protection
* Test your backup restoration process periodically to ensure you can recover your data
* The container performs an initial backup immediately on startup, then follows the configured interval
* Cleanup runs automatically at midnight each day (container time), deleting backups older than `RETAIN_DAYS`
